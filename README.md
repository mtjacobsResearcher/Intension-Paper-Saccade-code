The following code was written for the 2022 publication in Journal of Vision: [Subjective control of polystable illusory apparent motion: Is control possible when the stimulus affords countless motion possibilities?](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=HWHPG-AAAAAJ&citation_for_view=HWHPG-AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC)

The analysis designedd to confirm there wasn't a connection between saccades and percepts. The code implements the saccade model from [Engbert and Kleigl (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903000841?via%3Dihub).
